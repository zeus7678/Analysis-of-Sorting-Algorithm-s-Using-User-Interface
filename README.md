# Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithm-s-Using-User-Interface
The project aims at designing and analysis of Sorting Algorithm's , GUI gives clarity how sorting actually happen in back-end code.
# Several popular sorting algorithms like heap, quick, merge, counting, bubble, selection. Performed Graphical
User Interface visualisation in Object Oriented Programming using multi threading concepts.


#Merge Sort :
Video shows how actually merge sort looks like, when it runs, how comparison are done, Merge Sort contains mainly five method  
SmallMoveLD() -- It moves left half to down
SmallMoveRD()-- It moves right half to up
SwapLevel()    --  It merge the two sorted array
SmallMoveLU() --It moves left half to up
SmallMoveRU()--It moves right half to up

#Selection Sort:
It only works on SwapLevel()
